## Multilingual Language Translation System
**Multilingual Language Translation System** is a powerful tool that allows users to easily translate text between multiple languages. Whether you need to quickly understand content in a foreign language or communicate with people from different parts of the world, this system has got you covered.

## Features

- **Language Detection**: Our system accurately predicts the language of the provided text. It's a handy feature when you're not sure which language you're dealing with.

- **Translation Support**: While currently supporting a limited set of languages, our system is designed with extensibility in mind. Adding more languages is on our roadmap.

- **Streamlined Interface**: The user-friendly Streamlit interface makes it easy for anyone to use. Enter your text, click "Submit," and get instant results.

- **Future Expansion**: We are committed to improving this system. In the future, we plan to enhance accuracy, speed, and introduce features for seamless translation between languages.

## Try It Out

To experience the Multilingual Language Translation System in action, click on the following link: [WebApp](https://multilingualproject.streamlit.app/)

## Code Overview

The code behind this system is organized as follows:

- `main_app.py`: This is where the Streamlit app is defined. It handles the user interface, taking user input and displaying results.

- `language_translation.py`: This Python script contains the logic for language detection. It loads the language translation dataset, trains a LinearSVC model, and predicts the language of the user's input.

## Usage

Follow these simple steps to use the Multilingual Language Translation System:

1. Open the system in your web browser by accessing the [WebApp](https://multilingualproject.streamlit.app/).

2. You'll find a text input field. Enter the text you want to translate or detect the language for.

3. Click the "Submit" button.

4. The system will swiftly predict the language and display the result.

## Limitations

While our system is a valuable tool, it's important to note its current limitations:

- Language Support: We currently support a limited number of languages, and expanding this is a future goal.

- Accuracy: The system may not be as accurate as specialized translation tools. Accuracy improvements are part of our roadmap.

- Speed: Predicting languages can take some time, especially for longer texts.

## Future Enhancements

We are dedicated to enhancing the Multilingual Language Translation System:

- Expanding Language Support: Our team plans to add support for more languages to make it even more versatile.

- Accuracy Improvements: We aim to refine the language detection algorithm to increase accuracy.

- Speed Optimization: We'll work on making language prediction faster and more efficient.

- Translation Feature: In the future, we plan to implement a feature that allows users to translate text from one language to another.
